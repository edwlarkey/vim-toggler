INTRODUCTION                                           *toggler*

This plugin makes it easier to toggle between different sets of keywords. E.g.
[TODO, DOING, DONE], [YES, NO], [TRUE, FALSE], etc.

Inspiration came from Org Mode. I didn't really need all of the functionality
that it provided, but I did like how it could toggle between TODO and DONE for
tasks.

COMMANDS                                                 *toggler-commands*

There are no default mappings. There is simply one command.

:Toggle           Toggles to next keyword.

CONFIG                                                   *toggler-config*

Lists of keywords can be set in your vimrc.

The default set of keywords are:

>
  let g:toggler_keywords = [
    \ ['TODO', 'DOING', 'DONE'],
    \ ['Positive', 'Negative'],
    \ ['True', 'False'],
    \ ['YES', 'NO'],
    \ ['\[ \]', '\[x\]'],
    \]
<


This is what I use in my vimrc. I have a modified set of keywords as well as
<leader>t mapped to :Toggle

>
  :nnoremap <leader>t :Toggle<CR>

  let g:toggler_keywords = [
    \ ['TODO', 'DOING', 'DONE'],
    \ ['YES', 'NO'],
    \ ['\[ \]', '\[x\]'],
    \]
