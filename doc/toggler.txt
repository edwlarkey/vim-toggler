INTRODUCTION                                           *toggler*

This plugin makes it easier to toggle between different sets of keywords. E.g.
[TODO, DOING, DONE], [YES, NO], [TRUE, FALSE], etc.

Inspiration came from Org Mode. I didn't really need all of the functionality
that it provided, but I did like how it could toggle between TODO and DONE for
tasks.

COMMANDS                                                 *toggler-commands*

There are no default mappings. There is simply one command.

:Toggle           Toggles to next keyword.
